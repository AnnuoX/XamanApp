This is the repository for XUMM, the mobile XRPL client by [XRPL Labs](https://xrpl-labs.com). This repository contains the (React Native) app as (soon to be) listed in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

The app connects to the [XUMM platform](https://github.com/XRPL-Labs/xumm-api) for sign requests: the most user friendly way to get paid / request a payment over the XRP ledger (in either XRP or any other issued currency). 

## If you are a developer

If you are a developer and you wish to engage with XUMM users, please take a look at the [XUMM Developer Dashboard](https://apps.xumm.dev/) and [read the docs](https://xumm.readme.io/).
