![Contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-orange.svg)

This is the repository for XUMM, the mobile XRPL client by [XRPL Labs](https://xrpl-labs.com). This repository contains the (React Native) app.

The app connects to the [XUMM platform](https://github.com/XRPL-Labs/xumm-api) for sign requests: the most user friendly way to get paid / request a payment over the XRP ledger (in either XRP or any other issued currency). 

You can download our app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1492302343) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xrpllabs.xumm), or build it yourself.

If you are a developer and you wish to engage with XUMM users, please take a look at the [XUMM Developer Dashboard](https://apps.xumm.dev/) and [read the docs](https://xumm.readme.io/).
